          <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          After the Financial Consolidation of Part B States with effect from
          01.04.1950, the States of Travancore and Kochi were brought under the
          control of the Collector of Central Excise, Madras, for the purpose of
          collection of Central Excise and Customs duties. The Malabar area, in
          north Kerala, was already under the administrative jurisdiction of the
          Collector of Central Excise, Madras, before 01.04.1950 as a part of
          the Mangalore Central Excise formation.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          On 01.05.1960, a separate Collectorate was formed, based at Kochi,
          under a Collector of Customs & Central Excise having control over two
          wings: Kochi Custom House and Central Excise and Customs. In May,
          1983, the Custom House, Kochi and the Collectorate of Central Excise,
          Kochi being placed under a Collector of Customs and a Collector of
          Central Excise respectively.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          The next major change was when the jurisdiction of the Kochi Central
          Excise Commissionerate was bifurcated on 16.7.1997 and a new
          Commissionerate of Central Excise, Kochi-II (later renamed as
          Commissionerate of Central Excise, Calicut) was formed having
          jurisdiction mainly of the northern part of Kerala while Kochi
          Commissionerate retained it’s jurisdiction over the rest of Kerala. In
          early 1999, the headquarters of the new Commissionerate was shifted to
          Calicut.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          Finally, in 2002, as part of cadre-restructuring, the Commissionerates
          of Central Excise, Kochi and Calicut were further re-organised and a
          new Commissionerate was formed at Trivandrum having jurisdiction over
          the southern part of Kerala. As part of the restructuring, the
          anti-smuggling formations all over Kerala which were earlier under the
          respective Central Excise Commissionerates were brought under a new
          Commissionerate of Customs (Preventive) with its headquarters at
          Kochi. During this year, the Central Excise Commissionerates in Kerala
          which had hitherto been under the administrative control of the Chief
          Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise, Bangalore were brought
          under the control of the newly created post of Chief Commissioner of
          Central Excise, Kochi.
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          The next major change came with the introduction of GST with effect
          from 01.07.2017. Kochi Central Tax and Central Excise Commissionerate
          came into existence in place of Central Excise Commissionerate from
          22.06.2017 consequent to reorganization of CBEC formations in view of
          the implementation of GST.

          The Commissionerate Head Quarters is situated at Kochi itself. Two
          Division offices i.e. Ernakulam Division and Kakkanad Division, along
          with the Range offices of these Divisions are also located in Kochi
          except for Kavaratti Range of Ernakulam Division, which is located at
          Kavaratti of Lakshadweep. Other Division Offices and Range Offices
          under them are located in their respective jurisdictional areas.
